%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Subimages/mesh
NBlockY=40;     %Double, sets number of image splittings in Y axis. Resulting mesh is NBlockX x NBlockY grid of subimages.
NBlockX=40;		%Double, sets number of image splittings in X axis.

%--Morphological filtering:
%Erosion/Dilatation process
DiskRad=1; 		%Erosion disk radius, augment if noise is accumulated
NErosions=2;		 %Number of erosions and dilatations done, good between 2-3
%--

%Final Noise Removal (Very important & time consuming)
MinClusterSize=350; 	%Sets the minimum cluster size. Noise clusters ~ 100-500.

%%Generic Filters
MedFilt=false;      %Boolean, enable/disable median filter.
GaussBlur=false;    %Boolean, enable/disable gaussian blur. Useful only if good contrast between noise/signal
GaussSpread=30; 	%Double, set GaussianBlur spread, smooths results but mixes noise with signal, dificulting the erosion process.
imgEq=false;        %Boolean, enable disable image histogram equalization. Useful if wanting to check results. Be sure to enable "img" writing.

%%%%Image characteristics%%%%
inverted=false;	    %Boolean, enable if the inverted domains are white instead of the expected black.
double_domain=false;%Boolean, enable if the original uncutted imaged contained multiple domains (In order to ignore blank area).
